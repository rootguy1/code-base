# There are two utility scripts:
#	1. Seeplogs.pl
# Purpose:
# Parse the syslog messages file “/var/log/messages” and search for a keyword pattern given in a pattern file “keyword.txt”

#	2. BubbleSort.pl

# Purpose:
# The output file produced by the Seeplogs.pl is used here as an input file.  The lines are loaded into arrays and keywords are separated from the messages. Then the messages are sorted according to keywords.
