# Author: Imran Ahmed <researcher6@live.com>
# Description: Nagios plugin that searches log files for a patterns loaded from a pattern file.
# Usage check_in_logfiles.py : <patfile> <logfile>
# First argument PATTERNFILE is a text file containing lines of the form:
# SEVERITY:PATTERN
# where *SEVERITY* is one of `IGNORE`, `WARNING`, `CRITICAL` and *PATTERN* is a
#  regular expression.
# Second (and later) argument LOGFILE is the path to one (or more) log files.
# if a line is found that matches a *PATTERN* with *SEVERITY* `CRITICAL`,
# exit with CRITICAL status 
# if a line is found that matches a *PATTERN* with *SEVERITY* `WARNING`,
# exit with WARNING status
